        <h2 style="margin:0 0 8px">What is ToolHouzz?</h2>
        <p>ToolHouzz is a collection of small, focused utilities for everyday tasks—calculators, converters, and mini games—designed to be fast, reliable, and respectful of your privacy. Our philosophy is simple: the best tools are the ones that stay out of your way. That means clear interfaces, sensible defaults, and zero sign-ups or paywalls. Most features run completely in your browser using modern web technologies, so your files and data don’t leave your device unless you explicitly choose to download or share them.</p>

        <h2>Why we built it</h2>
        <p>The internet is full of “free” tools that are slow, invasive, or overloaded with ads. We built ToolHouzz to be the opposite—lightweight, transparent, and genuinely helpful. Every feature is scoped to do one thing well: merge PDFs without watermarking, convert images without uploading them to a third-party server, calculate loan payments without filling a form with personal details, and more. We believe people deserve utilities that are safe to use at work, at school, and at home, without worrying about tracking or hidden costs.</p>

        <h2>Privacy by design</h2>
        <p>Privacy is not a feature we bolt on—it’s a design principle. Where possible, conversions and calculations run entirely on your device using client-side processing. For example, our PDF and image tools use in-browser libraries to manipulate files locally. When a tool requires a network request (for example, to load a font or library from a CDN), we choose reputable, widely cached providers and keep external dependencies minimal. We never sell personal information, and we avoid collecting it in the first place. Our privacy policy describes the small amount of technical data we may process to keep the site secure and functioning, and how you can contact us with questions.</p>

        <h2>How the tools are built</h2>
        <p>Each tool is engineered to be dependable and understandable. We favor open formats, sensible defaults, and clear messaging when something goes wrong. The interface is intentionally consistent across pages: dropzone for files, friendly buttons, helpful tips, and an optional “status” area so you can see exactly what’s happening. We test tools on modern browsers and follow accessibility best practices such as keyboard-friendly controls, ARIA attributes where appropriate, and color contrast that meets WCAG guidelines. If you use assistive technologies and run into any issues, please write to us—we’re committed to making improvements.</p>

        <h2>Performance matters</h2>
        <p>Speed is part of the user experience. We keep pages small, defer heavy logic until you need it, and use efficient libraries. When a tool performs a complex task—say, compressing a large PDF—we show progress and make sure the UI stays responsive. Our goal is to keep you informed without overwhelming you with technical details. If a process might take longer, we’ll explain why and suggest alternatives (for instance, reducing resolution before converting).</p>

        <h2>Reliability and correctness</h2>
        <p>Accuracy is just as important as speed. Financial calculators include clear definitions and formulas, and we label assumptions where relevant. Converters aim to preserve quality and metadata where possible, and we warn you when a format change could be lossy. We routinely check tools against sample datasets and edge cases to ensure predictable outputs. If you discover a discrepancy, we encourage you to send a minimal example so we can reproduce and fix the issue.</p>

        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>ToolHouzz will continue to expand carefully, prioritizing quality over quantity. Planned areas include additional document and audio utilities, a few more lightweight educational calculators, and opt-in features for power users (like presets and batch operations). We also want to deepen accessibility support—more keyboard shortcuts, better focus management, and descriptive help content that works well with screen readers.</p>

        <h2>Principles we follow</h2>
        <ul class="tip-list">
          <li><strong>Clarity over cleverness.</strong> Interfaces are obvious, labels are plain language, and defaults are sensible.</li>
          <li><strong>Local first.</strong> If a task can run in your browser, it should—reducing risk and latency.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimal data.</strong> Collect less, store less, worry less. We aim to process only what’s required.</li>
          <li><strong>Open formats.</strong> Favor standards that maximize portability and long-term access.</li>
          <li><strong>Kind failure modes.</strong> When something goes wrong, explain it and suggest what to try next.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who is ToolHouzz for?</h2>
        <p>Students who need a quick PDF merge before class. Designers converting a logo to a vector. Creators extracting a snippet of audio. Anyone who prefers a clean, ad-free experience and values privacy. Because our tools work in the browser, they’re available on most laptops, desktops, and modern mobile devices. Whether you visit once a month or keep the site pinned in your toolbar, the experience should feel polished and predictable every time.</p>

        <h2>How you can help</h2>
        <p>Feedback drives the roadmap. If a tool saves you time, tell us. If something confused you, tell us that too. You can report bugs, request features, or share sample files at <a href="mailto:tegbirsingh702@gmail.com">tegbirsingh702@gmail.com</a>. Messages with details—what you tried, what you expected, what happened—are especially helpful. We can’t guarantee every request will make it in, but we read everything and prioritize changes that improve clarity and reliability for most users.</p>

        <h2>Ethics and responsibility</h2>
        <p>We design with care and assume responsibility for how our tools might be used. While the utilities are general-purpose, we discourage harmful or unlawful activity and reserve the right to block abuse. We believe useful software can be built without exploiting attention or data. There is no dark pattern here: no surprise charges, no bait-and-switch, and no manipulative countdowns. If one day we introduce optional paid features to cover infrastructure costs, they will be clearly labeled and never degrade the free experience.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have a question about how a tool works, want to report an accessibility issue, or need a receipt for a donation or sponsorship, email us at <a href="mailto:tegbirsingh702@gmail.com">tegbirsingh702@gmail.com</a>. We aim to respond within a few business days. For legal or security disclosures, please include “Attention: Legal” or “Security” in your subject so we can route messages appropriately.</p>

        <h2>Thank you</h2>
        <p>Thanks for choosing ToolHouzz. Time is precious, and we’re honored you trust our tools to help you get things done. We’ll keep improving performance, accessibility, and clarity so you can focus on your task—not the tool.</p>
