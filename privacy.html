        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 1 August 2025</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>ToolHouzz is a privacy-first set of utilities. Most tools run locally in your browser, so your files do not leave your device unless you choose to download the results. We avoid collecting personal information and only process limited technical data necessary to operate, secure, and improve the website. This policy describes our practices in plain language. If anything here is unclear, please contact us at <a href="mailto:tegbirsingh702@gmail.com">tegbirsingh702@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Information we process</h2>
        <ul class="tip-list">
          <li><strong>Files you use with tools.</strong> When a tool works entirely in your browser (for example, merging or compressing PDFs, converting images), files are processed locally and are never uploaded to our servers. Temporary data exists only in your browser’s memory and is discarded when you leave the page or refresh.</li>
          <li><strong>Basic usage data.</strong> We may measure aggregated page views, feature usage, and error rates to keep the site reliable. Where possible we use privacy-respecting analytics or self-hosted logs without building profiles of individual visitors. We do not sell or rent personal data.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact information you send us.</strong> If you email us or provide feedback, we receive the information you choose to include—typically your email address and message. We use it to respond and to improve the product.</li>
          <li><strong>Cookies and local storage.</strong> Our tools prefer in-browser storage for preferences (for example, last used format). We avoid third-party tracking cookies. You can clear these preferences via your browser settings at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Purposes and legal bases</h2>
        <p>We process data to: (a) provide and maintain the services; (b) protect the security and integrity of the site; (c) understand aggregate usage to improve features; and (d) comply with applicable laws. For visitors in the EEA/UK, our legal bases under the GDPR/UK GDPR are legitimate interests (running a secure, useful website) and, when you contact us, performance of a contract or consent depending on the context.</p>

        <h2>Data retention</h2>
        <p>We aim to minimize retention. Files handled locally in your browser are never transmitted to us. Support emails are stored for as long as necessary to address your request and maintain appropriate records. Aggregated analytics or error logs are kept for a limited period to monitor reliability and capacity and then deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal information. We may share limited data with service providers who help us operate the site (for example, content delivery networks that serve static assets). These providers act on our instructions and must apply appropriate security measures. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the rights, safety, or property of ToolHouzz, our users, or the public.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data we process, including TLS for data in transit, minimal server-side storage, and restricted access controls. No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure; if we learn of a breach that affects your information, we will notify you when required by law and take steps to mitigate the impact.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul class="tip-list">
          <li><strong>Do not upload.</strong> For local-first tools, simply use the site—your files stay on your device. If a tool offers a cloud option in the future, it will be opt-in and clearly labeled.</li>
          <li><strong>Browser controls.</strong> You can block or clear cookies and local storage, use private browsing modes, and restrict permissions such as camera or microphone where applicable.</li>
          <li><strong>Communication preferences.</strong> If you email us, you can request that we delete your message history once an issue is resolved, subject to legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>GDPR/UK GDPR rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or receive a copy of your personal data; to restrict or object to certain processing; and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. To exercise these rights, contact <a href="mailto:tegbirsingh702@gmail.com">tegbirsingh702@gmail.com</a>. We may ask you to verify your identity to protect your privacy. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.</p>

        <h2>CCPA/CPRA (California) notice</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share personal information as those terms are defined by California law. We may disclose limited information to service providers for business purposes such as website hosting and security. California residents can request access to and deletion of personal information we hold about them by contacting us. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</p>

        <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
        <p>ToolHouzz is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.</p>

        <h2>International transfers</h2>
        <p>We may process information in countries other than your own. When we transfer personal data internationally, we take steps to protect it in accordance with this policy and applicable law, such as using standard contractual clauses with our providers when required.</p>

        <h2>Third-party links</h2>
        <p>Some pages may link to third-party sites (for example, documentation or open-source projects). We are not responsible for their practices. Review their policies to understand how they handle your information.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy to reflect improvements to the service, changes in law, or new practices. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and, where appropriate, provide a notice on the website. Your continued use of ToolHouzz after an update means you accept the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>Contact us</h2>
        <p>If you have privacy questions, requests, or feedback, email <a href="mailto:tegbirsingh702@gmail.com">tegbirsingh702@gmail.com</a>. We will do our best to respond promptly and transparently.</p>

        <p style="font-size:12px;color:var(--muted)">This policy is intended to provide clear information but is not legal advice. If you need advice for your specific situation, consult a qualified professional.</p>
