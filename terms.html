        <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 1 August 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the ToolHouzz website, including all tools, content, and services available at or through it (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and “you” includes both you and the organization.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction, or have permission from a parent or legal guardian, to use the Service. You are responsible for ensuring the Service is permitted under the laws that apply to you.</p>

        <h2>3. Changes</h2>
        <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the effective date above and may post a notice on the site. Your continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.</p>

        <h2>4. The Service</h2>
        <p>ToolHouzz provides browser-based utilities including calculators, file converters, and mini games. Many tools operate locally in your browser; some may rely on hosted components or third-party libraries to function. Features and availability may change without notice. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Service at any time.</p>

        <h2>5. Your responsibilities</h2>
        <ul class="tip-list">
          <li><strong>Use lawfully.</strong> You may not use the Service for unlawful, harmful, or infringing purposes, including violating intellectual property or privacy rights.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect limits.</strong> Do not interfere with the operation of the Service, attempt to bypass security, or overload our infrastructure. Automated scraping or high-volume requests are prohibited unless we provide written permission.</li>
          <li><strong>Content and files.</strong> You are responsible for the files you process and the outputs you generate. Ensure you have rights to use any content and that it is appropriate for your environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Accounts (if introduced)</h2>
        <p>Most tools do not require an account. If we introduce optional accounts or paid features later, you must provide accurate information, safeguard your credentials, and notify us of any unauthorized use. We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>The Service, including its design, code, and content, is protected by intellectual property laws. You may use the Service only as permitted by these Terms. You retain all rights to the files and content you process through the Service. We claim no ownership of your inputs or outputs. You grant us the limited rights necessary to operate the Service—for example, to host the website and deliver requested features.</p>

        <h2>8. User feedback</h2>
        <p>If you send feedback, ideas, or suggestions, you grant ToolHouzz a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual license to use, modify, and incorporate that feedback into the Service without obligation to you. This helps us improve the product while avoiding ownership disputes.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>The Service may reference or link to third-party libraries, CDNs, or websites. We are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices. Your use of third-party services is subject to their terms and policies.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, ToolHouzz and its contributors disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that outputs will meet your requirements. Calculators and converters are provided for convenience and educational purposes; you are responsible for verifying results before relying on them for decisions.</p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ToolHouzz and its contributors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or for loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of or inability to use the Service—even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for any claim relating to the Service is limited to the greater of (a) amounts you paid us in the 3 months before the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) USD $50.</p>

        <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ToolHouzz and its contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Service, your content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access immediately without notice if we believe you have violated these Terms, posed a risk to others, or for any reason at our discretion. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (for example, intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification) will survive.</p>

        <h2>14. Export and sanctions</h2>
        <p>You must comply with applicable export control and sanctions laws. You may not use the Service if you are barred from receiving services under the laws of your jurisdiction.</p>

        <h2>15. Governing law; disputes</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of your local jurisdiction where ToolHouzz is operated (without regard to conflict-of-laws principles). Any dispute will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in that jurisdiction. Where required by law, you may also have consumer rights in your country of residence that we do not limit by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <ul class="tip-list">
          <li><strong>Entire agreement.</strong> These Terms and the Privacy Policy are the entire agreement between you and ToolHouzz regarding the Service.</li>
          <li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force.</li>
          <li><strong>No waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.</li>
          <li><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.</li>
          <li><strong>Headings.</strong> Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.</li>
        </ul>
